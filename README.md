# Personal_Helper

My Helper is a web-based application that helps users to check their monthly expenses. Users can log in into their accounts to add, delete, edit their transactions.  The application will show all the transactions within a month and summarise the total expenses, income, and balance. 

The project is divided into two parts, Front-end and Back-end. For the Front-end part, I used HTML, CSS to decorate the layout of the user interface. For the Back-end part, I used TOMCAT, Java Servlet, JSP and MySql.
